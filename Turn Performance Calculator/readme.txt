Hello!

This is just a little passion project I threw together. 

It is meant to be used for getting a realistic idea of your planes turn performance under your given circumstances for flight sims.


Some things of note:

	1: Yes I am aware it looks like steamed ass. I am not much of a front-end dev so while I do intend to improve the looks
	eventually features come first.

	2: I tested the program in Chrome, Internet Explorer(RIP), Edge, and Firefox. I can confirm it works in all these browsers but I cannot guarantee it will work on other platforms although I doubt you will have any issues, it is all pretty vanilla code.


Features that will be added before any major graphical updates:

	Automatic calculation of bank angle from G load. 

	Various metric and imperial unit options for speed input.

Features that will be added eventally: 

	Preset performance charts for various aircraft(This one will take a while as it is going to be alot of reasearch).

	Dedicated mobile layout.

	Mobile app(!!!MABYE!!!)





As a final note please forgive any spelling errors in the code, most of it was written between 12:00AM and 5:00AM without any caffine.
